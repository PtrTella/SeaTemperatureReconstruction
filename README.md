# Sea Surface Temperature Reconstruction under Cloud Occlusion üåä‚òÅÔ∏è

This university project applies Deep Learning techniques to reconstruct sea surface temperature (SST) data occluded by cloud cover.
Satellite-based SST measurements (MODIS Aqua, nighttime) are often affected by cloud occlusion. The goal is to train a model that fills in missing data using surrounding information. Developed for a Deep Learning course, this project tackles a real-world problem in environmental data reconstruction.
